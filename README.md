## Overview

This repository consists of the C++ implementation of the Informed RRT* algorithm for autonomous navigation. Robotic vacuum
cleaners are becoming a household thing in our modern world and has a huge market potential. One of the main components of
the robotic vacuum cleaners is it's ability to plan a path from a given start to end point in an environment. This software
is developed for a fictional cleaning robot Xoomba for ACME Robotics, a fictional organization.

Sampling-based algorithms represent the configuration space with a roadmap of sampled configurations. These algorithms work 
well for high-dimensional configuration spaces, because unlike combinatorial algorithms, their running time is not 
(explicitly) exponentially dependent on the dimension of configurations.

Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is a planning technique for single-query problems which uses an incremental tree 
expansion from randomly drawn samples to grow towards previously unsearchable areas in the map space. Optimal RRTS (RRT*), 
an improvement on RRTs, extend the problem to finding the optimal solution in the planning space that is computed 
asymptotically. Informed RRT* improves the convergence speed of RRT* by introducing a heuristic, similar to the way in which 
A* improves upon Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

## GMock Tests
In the original project, Informed RRT Star planner was developed. The main project consisted of 5 classes -
1. Class Map to define the environment
2. Class RRTNode to describe a node in the environment.
3. Class RRT which implements the RRT planner. Map and RRTNode are a part of this class.
4. RRTStar planner derived from RRT class.
5. InformedRRTSTar planner derived from RRTStar planner.

As RRT class uses Map class, Map class is mocked and then the RRT class is tested. To mock the class Map, all of its methods are made virtual as well as the destructor. A new test MockRRTTest is developed in which a mock of Map class and a few of its' methods is created. This is subsequently tested with the initialization of RRT class which recieves environment information i.e boundary and obstacle information and creates an instance of class Map to store the information. 

In the gmock test, RRT class is initialized with the mocked map class, which is derived from the original Map class, and the mocked map class initialization is tested. 
 
To instructions to run the unit tests are given in the Install section.

## Result

## Solo Iterative Process (SIP)
Solo Iterative Process (SIP) is used in the development of the project. Test Driven Development appoach is used to comply with the short development cycle. The planning and development of the project is done in four sprints.

## Dependencies

1. [matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp), a simple C++ plotting library, resemble the plotting API used by Matlab, is used to facilitate visualization.

2. Google Test framework for unit testing - gtest and gmock.

### Installation
matplotlib-cpp works by wrapping the popular python plotting library matplotlib. (matplotlib.org) This means you have to have a working python installation, including development headers. On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-numpy python2.7-dev
```
The C++-part of the library consists of the single header file matplotlibcpp.h which can be placed anywhere. Place this in the include directory of the project.

### CMake
Since the build system is CMake, the following is added to the CMakeLists.txt:
```
find_package(PythonLibs 2.7)
target_include_directories(myproject PRIVATE ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(myproject ${PYTHON_LIBRARIES})
```
where myproject is the project to be built.

## Standard install via command-line

Note: The following branch only implements the RRT planner as GMock test is written for Map class and tested with RRT class which uses the Map class.

```
git clone https://github.com/SrinidhiSreenath/ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar.git --branch GMock_Extra_Credit
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app
```

## Building for code coverage
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

## Doxygen Documentation
Doxygen Documentation generation steps:
```
cd <path to repository>
mkdir Doxygen
cd Doxygen
doxygen -g <config_file_name>
```
Open configuration file and update the following:
```
PROJECT_NAME = 'ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar'
INPUT = ../InformedRRTStar ../include ../test
```
Run and generate the documents by executing the following:
```
doxygen <config_file_name>
```
