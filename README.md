## Overview

This repository consists of the C++ implementation of the Informed RRT* algorithm for autonomous navigation. Robotic vacuum
cleaners are becoming a household thing in our modern world and has a huge market potential. One of the main components of
the robotic vacuum cleaners is it's ability to plan a path from a given start to end point in an environment. This software
is developed for a fictional cleaning robot Xoomba for ACME Robotics, a fictional organization.

Sampling-based algorithms represent the configuration space with a roadmap of sampled configurations. These algorithms work 
well for high-dimensional configuration spaces, because unlike combinatorial algorithms, their running time is not 
(explicitly) exponentially dependent on the dimension of configurations.

Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is a planning technique for single-query problems which uses an incremental tree 
expansion from randomly drawn samples to grow towards previously unsearchable areas in the map space. Optimal RRTS (RRT*), 
an improvement on RRTs, extend the problem to finding the optimal solution in the planning space that is computed 
asymptotically. Informed RRT* improves the convergence speed of RRT* by introducing a heuristic, similar to the way in which 
A* improves upon Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

## Solo Iterative Process (SIP)
Solo Iterative Process (SIP) is used in the development of the project. Test Driven Development appoach is used to comply with the short development cycle. The planning and development of the project is done in four sprints.

## Dependencies

[matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp), a simple C++ plotting library, resemble the plotting API used by Matlab, is used to facilitate visualization.

## Standard install via command-line
```
git clone https://github.com/SrinidhiSreenath/ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar.git
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app
```

## Building for code coverage
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

## Working with Eclipse IDE ##

## Installation

In your Eclipse workspace directory (or create a new one), checkout the repo (and submodules)
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/SrinidhiSreenath/ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar.git
```

In your work directory, use cmake to create an Eclipse project for an [out-of-source build] of ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar

```
cd ~/workspace
mkdir -p InformedRRTStar-eclipse
cd InformedRRTStar-eclipse
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION=4.7.0 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ARG1=-std=c++14 ../ENPM808X-Midterm-InformedRRTStar/
```

## Import

Open Eclipse, go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> 
Select "InformedRRTStar-eclipse" directory created previously as root directory -> Finish

# Edit

Source files may be edited under the "[Source Directory]" label in the Project Explorer.


## Build

To build the project, in Eclipse, unfold InformedRRTStar-eclipse project in Project Explorer,
unfold Build Targets, double click on "all" to build all projects.

## Run

1. In Eclipse, right click on the InformedRRTStar-eclipse in Project Explorer,
select Run As -> Local C/C++ Application

2. Choose the binaries to run (e.g. shell-app, cpp-test for unit testing)


## Debug


1. Set breakpoint in source file (i.e. double click in the left margin on the line you want 
the program to break).

2. In Eclipse, right click on the boilerplate-eclipse in Project Explorer, select Debug As -> 
Local C/C++ Application, choose the binaries to run (e.g. shell-app).

3. If prompt to "Confirm Perspective Switch", select yes.

4. Program will break at the breakpoint you set.

5. Press Step Into (F5), Step Over (F6), Step Return (F7) to step/debug your program.

6. Right click on the variable in editor to add watch expression to watch the variable in 
debugger window.

7. Press Terminate icon to terminate debugging and press C/C++ icon to switch back to C/C++ 
perspetive view (or Windows->Perspective->Open Perspective->C/C++).


## Plugins

- CppChEclipse

    To install and run cppcheck in Eclipse

    1. In Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> cppcheclipse.
    Set cppcheck binary path to "/usr/bin/cppcheck".

    2. To run CPPCheck on a project, right click on the project name in the Project Explorer 
    and choose cppcheck -> Run cppcheck.


- Google C++ Sytle

    To include and use Google C++ Style formatter in Eclipse

    1. In Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style -> Formatter. 
    Import [eclipse-cpp-google-style][reference-id-for-eclipse-cpp-google-style] and apply.

    2. To use Google C++ style formatter, right click on the source code or folder in 
    Project Explorer and choose Source -> Format
